# WeatherBit API Project

This is the second (and simplified) version of my project for the API challenge. The first version, together with an explanation for the change, can be found at the bottom of this README file.

This version uses HTML, JS and CSS together with a hosting through GitHub Pages. The working version of this project can be accessed through the link below:
